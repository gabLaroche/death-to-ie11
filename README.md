# Death to Internet Explorer 11

this is a fun little app that counts down to the end of support of Internet Explorer 11 + a few more features like a list of articles/websites that tell you why you should stop supporting IE11 and a list of websites that already dropped support.

[check it out in action](https://death-to-ie11.com/)

Want to contribute by adding a few reasons why people should stop supporting IE11 or by adding websites that stopped supporting IE11?
